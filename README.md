# AngularJS To-Do List

A simple to-do list application created to demonstrate the material learned in the AngularJS portion of Udacity's Front End Frameworks course and Koushik Kothagal's [Thinking in AngularJS](https://javabrains.io/courses/angularjs_thinking1/) course. The application was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and most importantly, AngularJS (1.X).

## Instructions

1. After cloning or downloading this repository, open index.html in a web browser. Alternatively, you may visit the web page [here](https://abequinonez.github.io/angularjs-todo-list).

2. Add a new to-do item by entering text into the main text input and then pressing the enter/return key.

3. Mark an existing to-do item as complete by clicking on the checkbox (appearing as an empty circle) to the left of the item. You may undo this action by clicking on the checkbox again.

4. Edit an existing to-do item by double-clicking on the item. Enter the desired changes and then either press the enter key or simply click outside of the item's text input.

5. Delete an existing to-do item by clicking on the delete button (appearing as an 'X') to the right of the item.
